"""Phase 3.6 bot menu commands — the 4 entries that show up under the
Telegram bot menu button (corner of the chat input).

These are **shortcuts**, not the rich /menu inline UI:

  /start     — onboarding entry
  /menu      — opens the rich 5-category inline menu (the real UX)
  /help      — short usage guide (handled via Phase 3.5 HELP intent)
  /dashboard — opens the wealth Mini App in-place

The bot menu button is a Telegram-native list of slash commands — tapping
one inserts the command into the input and sends it. So each command
must have a working route somewhere in the worker; missing handlers
would silently fall through to the unclear-message branch.

Routing of these slash commands lives in ``workers/telegram_worker._handle_message``:
  - ``/start`` and ``/menu`` already had explicit branches before Epic 2
  - ``/help`` matches the rule-based pattern in ``intent_patterns.yaml``
    and resolves through the normal text path
  - ``/dashboard`` is wired in the worker as part of Epic 2

Old Phase 3A commands (``/themtaisan``, ``/taisan``, ``/report``, ``/goals``,
``/market``) still work as text — they just no longer appear in the menu
button list. Surfacing 4 high-leverage entry points reduces decision
friction; the rich /menu is one tap away for everything else.
